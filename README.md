# Sales-Prediction
The purpose of this project is to identify properties of products and outlets that play a crucial role in increasing sales. 

Bigmart is a supermarket chain, with stores throughout the United States. The senior management team is requesting a comprehensive sales projection model that can predict the sales per product for each store. 

Bigmart has collected sales data for 1,559 unique products across 10 stores.
